# LucOS
So LucOS is an "Operational System" that is inspired by operating systems, we are not capable of making a complete operating system so we are making what we call an operational system, a system that imitates an os but is running on windows.

LucOS is developed in python an you need to have python installed before running the system.
To start up the system, navigate to '(Version name/main folder) \ LucSys \ Boot \' and run Boot.exe or Boot.py, they are the same.
